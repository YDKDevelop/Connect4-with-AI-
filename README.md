# Connect4-with-AI-
## What is Connect4?
Connect4 is a game played on a vertical board which has seven columns and six rows. Each column has a hole in the upper part of the board, where pieces are introduced. There is a window for every square, so that pieces can be seen from both sides. Both players have a set of 21 thin pieces (like coins); each of them uses a different colour. The board is empty at the start of the game.

## Objective
The aim for both players is to make a straight line of four own pieces; the line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal

## Requirements

- Python 3
